The famous childhood game, The Hangman. 
A good starting project to test your JS skills. 

JS technologies used: DOM Manipulation, API, Event Listeners.
At first I used an API call to get the words from an external source.
As a fallback method, I used an array of not-so-used words in English from which the code randomly selects one of them.
